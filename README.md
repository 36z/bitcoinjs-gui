# bitcoinjs-gui

JavaScript client for the BitcoinJS API. This client connects to an
[Exit Node](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/node-bitcoin-exit) and a
[Wallet Node](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/node-bitcoin-wallet) to
provide a full Bitcoin client in the browser.

# Status

The basic exit node functionality is implemented. However the client
does not yet support the wallet API.

Prototype software, use at your own peril.
